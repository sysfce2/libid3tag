===============================================================================

Version 0.16.4
  * Allow files greater than 2 GiB on 32-bit UNIX-based/UNIX-like systems.
  * Add support for generating source packages with CPack.
  * id3_tag_parse() now returns the number of parsed frames so far instead of
    trashing the entire tag.
  * Update ID3v1 genre list.
    * Add genres from Winamp 5.60.
    * Rename offensive genre.
    * Auto-generate genre list code at build time.
  * Require gperf at build time to generate gperf code.
  * Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.10.
  * Reorganize source tree.
  * Fix mojibake with UTF-16LE-encoded tags.
  * Fix build under pure C toolchain.
  * Fix support for PIC frames, including setting the correct MIME type.
  * Fix some miscellaneous build warnings.
  * Improve iTunes compatibility.
  * Apply more patches from Perl's Audio::Scan and FreeBSD.

Version 0.16.3
  * Fix backward compatibility with libid3tag 0.15.1b.

Version 0.16.2
  * Fix null pointer dereference in id3_ucs4_length (CVE-2017-11550)

Version 0.16.1
  * Fix exported CMake config file
  * Fix pkgconfig file name to match Linux distro packages
    (id3tag instead of libid3tag).

Version 0.16.0
  * Add CMake build system
  * Remove autotools
  * Apply patches from Debian, Fedora, Arch, and Gentoo

Version 0.15.1 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.59, automake 1.8.2, libtool 1.5.2.

  * Fixed a potential problem in file.c when writing empty ID3v2 tags.

  * Added new id3_field_gettextencoding() API routine.

Version 0.15.0 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.57, automake 1.7.5, libtool 1.4.3.

  * Added new id3_tag_version(), id3_tag_options(), id3_tag_setlength(),
    id3_frame_field(), id3_field_getlatin1(), id3_field_getfulllatin1(),
    id3_genre_index(), id3_genre_number(), id3_latin1_ucs4duplicate(),
    id3_utf16_ucs4duplicate(), and id3_utf8_ucs4duplicate() API routines.

  * Properly exposed the id3_frame_new(), id3_frame_delete(), and
    id3_field_type() API routines.

  * Fixed a possible segmentation fault rendering ID3v1 tags when a tag
    field exceeds the field length limit.

  * Fixed a problem whereby the file interface could try to seek and read
    data from a non-seekable stream, unrecoverably losing data from the
    stream. (N.B. the fix does not work under Win32.)

  * Fixed a problem reading ID3v2.2 frames which corrupted their frame IDs
    and caused them not to be re-rendered.

  * Improved rendering of the ID3v1 genre field from ID3v2 genre
    names/numbers. The genre "Other" is used in place of non-translatable
    genres.

  * Rendering an empty ID3v1 tag now properly returns 0 length even when a
    null buffer pointer is passed.

  * Changed the file implementation to maintain information about present
    but unparsable tags, instead of ignoring all tags and returning an
    error.

  * Added an external dependency on zlib (libz), which is no longer
    included.

  * Changed to build a shared library by default.

  * Changed to use native Cygwin build by default; give --host=mingw32 to
    `configure' to use MinGW (and avoid a dependency on the Cygwin DLL).

Version 0.14.2 (beta)

  * Changed Cygwin builds to use MinGW; resulting Win32 executables no
    longer have a dependency on Cygwin DLLs.

Version 0.14.1 (beta)

  * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest upstream versions.

  * Enabled libtool versioning rather than release numbering.

  * Renamed `libid3' to `libid3tag' and enabled installation as a separate
    library.

  * Several other small fixes.

Version 0.14.0 (beta)

  * Added a new ID3 tag manipulation library (libid3). The required zlib
    support is provided either by the host system or by the included static
    library implementation (libz).

  * Improved MSVC++ portability and added MSVC++ project files.
